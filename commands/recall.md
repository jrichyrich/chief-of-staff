argument-hint: "[what to search for]"
---

The user wants to retrieve facts from their persistent memory. Use the `query_memory` MCP tool to search for matching facts. If they specify a category (personal, preference, work, relationship, backlog), filter by that category.

Present the results clearly. If no results found, suggest they use /remember to store facts first.
